# License scope

## Project-owned material

Except where a file or directory says otherwise, copyrightable material in
this repository for which the Quran Roots Dictionary Project controls the
rights is offered under the **GNU General Public License, version 3 only
(GPL-3.0-only)**.

This includes, to the extent rights are held by the project:

- publication/build/validation scripts;
- maintained research pipeline scripts authored for this project;
- the static website;
- project documentation;
- the arrangement/compilation of the public release;
- original human-authored and AI-assisted synthesis/editing embodied in the
  root dictionary, to the extent such material is copyrightable and the
  project has rights to license it.

The full GPLv3 text is in `LICENSE`.

## Third-party material is not relicensed

The project cannot grant rights it does not own. Third-party source material,
annotations, databases, editions, trademarks, and other rights remain subject
to their own licenses and terms.

See:

- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- `data/DATA_LICENSE.md`
- `docs/LICENSING.md`
- `docs/SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`

## Important QAC limitation

The public dictionary is materially informed by Quranic Arabic Corpus (QAC)
morphology and annotations. QAC's current public pages are not fully internally
consistent about reuse:

- the download page identifies the morphology data as GNU GPL and links GPLv3;
- the download terms also state that verbatim copies of the morphology file
  may not be changed and require QAC attribution in derived works;
- the QAC FAQ separately describes research use as non-commercial.

Because the Quran Roots Dictionary Project cannot resolve that inconsistency
on QAC's behalf, this repository does **not** represent that the QAC-derived
parts of `data/` are cleared for unrestricted commercial use.

Until QAC provides clarification or separate permission, downstream users
should treat the QAC-derived dataset as suitable for research/non-commercial
reuse under the applicable QAC terms, or obtain permission from QAC for a use
that depends on broader rights.

This QAC caveat does not restrict independently authored project code that
does not contain QAC data.

## Quran Foundation boundary

Raw Quran Foundation/Quran.com API content is not included in this public
repository. The public release builder recursively removes every
`context_gloss` field from the frozen v8 root corpus before publication.

Quran Foundation's current Developer Terms prohibit redistribution of QF
Content or raw API data without a separate written license. This repository
therefore does not grant or purport to grant redistribution rights in QF
Content.

## No warranty / no legal advice

GPLv3's warranty disclaimer applies to GPL-covered project material.

The licensing notes in this repository document the project's best-effort
reading of the cited upstream materials as of 2026-09-09. They are not legal
advice and do not replace the upstream terms.
